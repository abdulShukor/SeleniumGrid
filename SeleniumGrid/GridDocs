Selenium Grid:

Selenium-Grid allows you run your tests on different machines against different browsers 
5 testcases 
Selenium-Grid support distributed test execution. 
You can also run the Tests in Parallel in multiple machines on Selenium Grid
HUB- IE 9  -   chrome browser,IE11
50 testcases

 
What is Hub?
•	The Hub is the central point that will receive all the test request and distribute them the the right nodes.
There should only be one hub in a grid.
The machine containing the hub is where the tests will be triggered, but you will see the browser being automated on the node.
•	

•	Node :
Nodes are the Selenium instances that will execute the tests that you loaded on the hub. Nodes can be launched on multiple machines with different platforms and browsers.
•	

Steps 
1.	Download Selenium server jar
2.	Started the hub
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.8.1.jar -role hub

3.	Login to another machine and register it as node for Hub 
4.	Download the selenium server jar in node machine as well/ Check java-
5.	java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.8.1.jar -role webdriver -hub >ipaddress>/grid/register -port 5566
( Check if java is configured in system variables)
